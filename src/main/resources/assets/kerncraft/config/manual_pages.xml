            [red]Chemical elements[reset] are the building block of everything you
            see. Currently we know of 118 chemical elements, but it is quite possible
            we will be able to observe many more elements in the future.
            [p/]
            The [b]first step[b/] of the aspiring chemist is to obtain suitable
            containers for chemical elements.
            [p/]
            One of the simplest chemical element is Hydrogen. Let's try and produce some
            of it, shall we?
            [p/]
            Water has the chemical formula H_2O. That means, it is made out of two atoms of
            Hydrogen and one of Oxygen. To separate the Hydrogen from the Oxygen, all we need
            is to apply a strong electrical current to liquid water.
            [p/]
            The first step is to build a source of electricity. To do so, we will use a potato
            battery: let's stick two metals into a potato to obtain a makeshift battery.

            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
            but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
            encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
            anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
            it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
            and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
            which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
            some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
            avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
