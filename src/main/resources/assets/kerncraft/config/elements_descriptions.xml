            Hydrogen is the simplest element you can think of. In its common
            form it's made out of a single Proton. However, it can be found
            in two rare variants: [b]Deuterium[/b] (with a single Neutron and
            a single Proton) and [b]Tritium[/b], which is made out of a Neutron
            and two Protons.

            The newbie chemist might want to obtain Hydrogen
            at first. Hydrogen is easy to obtain: you just need a source of electricity
            (somebody said potato?) and some fresh water. The idea is the following:
            a molecule of Water (H20 for short) is made out of two atoms of Hydrogen
            and [b]Oxygen[/b]. Those two atoms are glued together. We just need to pull them
            apart and observe the magic as it happens.
            [br/]
            Precautions: Hydrogen is
            dangerous: together with Oxygen and a spark it causes a violent explosion.
            If you do not believe me, look up the Wikipedia page for Hindenburg disaster.
