            [b][blue]Hydrogen[b/] is the simplest element you can think of. In its common
            form it's made out of a single [red]Proton[reset], with, most of the time,
            an [gold]Electron[reset]
            wandering around like a moon. However, it can be found
            in two rare variants: [b]Deuterium[b/] (with a single [green]Neutron[reset] and
            a single [red]Proton[reset]) and [b]Tritium[b/], which is made out of a Neutron
            and two Protons.
            [p/]
            Most of the Universe (say 75%) is made out of Hydrogen. On [s]Earth[s/] Mineworld,
            most of the Hydrogen is in its bi-atomic form H_2, which consists of two atoms
            of Hydrogen glued together trough what is known (with a fancy term) as
            [b]Covalent bound[b/].
            This just means that the two Hydrogen atoms share (most of the time happily)
            their own Electrons.
            [p/]
            Hydrogen is odorless, colorless (why can't we just say it's transparent?)
            and tasteless (yes, you've read this correctly).
            [p/]
            The [u]novel chemist[u/] might want to obtain [blue]Hydrogen[reset]
            as first thing. Hydrogen is easy to obtain: you just need a source of electricity
            (somebody said potato?) and some fresh water. The idea is the following:
            a molecule of Water (H_20 for short) is made out of two atoms of Hydrogen
            and one of [b]Oxygen[b/]. Those two atoms are glued together.
            We just need to pull them
            apart using electricity and observe the magic as it happens.
            [p/]
            [u]Precautions:[u/][br/]
            [li] [red]Explosive[reset]: Hydrogen is dangerous and together with Oxygen
            and a spark it causes a violent explosion.
            If you do not believe me, look up the Wikipedia page for Hindenburg disaster.
            [br/]
            [li] [magenta]Not tasty[reset]: yeah, do not use Hydrogen as salad dressing.
            [br/]
            [u]Uses:[u/][br/]
            [li] [red]Fuel[reset]: due to his high reactivity it is very useful as
            fuel. In particular for rockets. But also for cars. It is also very light,
            so you can use it to fill your Zeppelin (strongly discouraged, see above).
            The nice thing is that the discarded element from Hydrogen combustion is just
            Water.

            [b][blue]Helium[b/] is the second element of the periodic table.

            [u]Uses:[u/][br/]
            [li] [red]Cryogenics[reset]: being liquid at even the smallest temperatures
            (Helium melts at [blue]1K[reset], but only with high pressure),
            Helium is quite useful to cool down stuff,
            without solidifying or condensing. This can be used to cool
            down superconductors (that can
            be used to power very strong magnets).
            [br/]
            [li] [red]Balloons[reset]: since helium is quite light, it can be used to

            [li] [blue]Air[reset]: Helium can be extracted from earths atmosphere
            using its lightness and low boiling point.
